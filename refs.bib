	abstract = {An especially important aspect in the analysis of performance for financial instruments is the determination of the correlation existing between the evolution of its performance and the overall trend of the capital market. The determination of such econometric model ensures, for capital investors, a series of information necessary in order to establish their behaviour in the subsequent periods. Within the research, the regression econometric model was used with the aim to evaluate the relation between the performance of a portfolio of financial instruments and the evolution of the corresponding capital market. The portfolio is made of ten financial titles, quoted on the main market of the Bucharest Stock Exchange. The dataset which offers the source data for analysis includes details regarding the daily evolution in 2012 of the selected shares.},

	abstract = {Background
Additive Bayesian Network (ABN) is a graphical model which extends Generalized Linear Modelling (GLM) to multiple dependent variables. The present study compares results from GLM with those from ABN analysis used to identify factors associated with Leptospira interrogans sv Pomona (Pomona) infection by exploring the advantages and disadvantages of these two methodologies, to corroborate inferences informing health and safety measures at abattoirs in New Zealand (NZ).
Methodology and findings
In a cohort study in four sheep slaughtering abattoirs in NZ, sera were collected twice a year from 384 meat workers and tested by Microscopic Agglutination with a 91\% sensitivity and 94\% specificity for Pomona. The study primarily addressed the effect of work position, personal protective equipment (PPE) and non-work related exposures such as hunting on a new infection with Pomona. Significantly associated with Pomona were “Work position” and two “Abattoirs” (GLM), and “Work position” (ABN). The odds of Pomona infection (OR, [95\% CI]) was highest at stunning and hide removal (ABN 41.0, [6.9–1044.2]; GLM 57.0, [6.9–473.3]), followed by removal of intestines, bladder, and kidneys (ABN 30.7, [4.9–788.4]; GLM 33.8, [4.2–271.1]). Wearing a facemask, glasses or gloves (PPE) did not result as a protective factor in GLM or ABN.
Conclusions/Significance
The odds of Pomona infection was highest at stunning and hide removal. PPE did not show any indication of being protective in GLM or ABN. In ABN all relationships between variables are modelled; hence it has an advantage over GLM due to its capacity to capture the natural complexity of data more effectively.},

	abstract = {Ground water levels measured in the vicinity of pumping wells are kriged using a regional-linear and point-logarithmic drift, the latter derived from the approximation to the Theis equation for drawdown in response to a pumping well. Kriging is widely used throughout the hydrogeologic discipline, most commonly as the preferred method for constructing gridded hydrogeologic datasets suitable for contouring. Residuals arising from using the most common (linear) drift to krige water levels in the vicinity of extraction wells often indicate large local departures from the linear drift, which correlate with areas of drawdown. The combined regional-linear and point-logarithmic drift accounts for these drawdowns using a logarithmic approximation for the curvature of the poten-tiometric surface. The drift model approximates the principal physical processes that govern ground water flow and ultimately govern the autocorrelation of ground water elevation data. This approach produces maps of contoured water levels that more realistically represent physical conditions and allow for improved interpretation of measured water-level data by including features and information known to be present. Additional benefits include an improved estimate of the regional (background) hydraulic gradient and generation of an approximately flow-conserved grid suitable for two-dimensional particle tracking.},

	abstract = {Land use regression (LUR) models that predict intra-urban variability of traffic-related air pollution are frequently used to inform exposure assessments in epidemiological studies. Spatially extending models built in city centres to unmeasured surrounding areas could be beneficial as it increases the size of area available for exposure assessment, which can improve the statistical power of health studies. However, past studies have shown poor performance when these models were transferred to unmeasured areas. In this study, ambient concentrations of black carbon (BC), ultrafine particles (UFP), nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with response times ranging from 1 s to 20 s were measured in the summer using a mobile laboratory. These ambient concentrations were temporally deconvolved into local, neighbourhood- and regional-background time-series signals. The temporally resolved signals were used to develop resolved LUR models (i.e. local, neighbourhood-background and regional-background models) while unresolved LUR models were developed from total ambient concentrations (i.e., measurements that were not temporally resolved). Both resolved and unresolved LUR models displayed modest R2 values when compared to models developed from fixed sites which may be due to the mobile nature of our data. External validation of the resolved and unresolved models within the models' original geographic domain showed comparable performance for BC (R2 for resolved vs. unresolved: 0.44 vs. 0.47), UFP (0.34 vs. 0.35), NO (0.18 vs. 0.19) and NO2 (0.42 vs.0.40). However, the resolved models were better able to assess exposure than the unresolved models when they were spatially extended to suburban areas bordering the urban area: UFP (R2: 0.42 vs. 0.29), NO2 (0.36 vs 0.26), NO (0.21 vs 0.14) and BC (0.32 vs 0.30). Furthermore, the resolved models were better able to predict the observed variability in suburban areas with both similar and different land uses to the urban area.},
